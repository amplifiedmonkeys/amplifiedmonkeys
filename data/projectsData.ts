      "The kinetic typography animation for Jallikattu is a fan-driven tribute to Lijo Jose Pellissery’s thought-provoking film, designed to capture its intense themes of chaos, masculinity, and societal fragility through dynamic text. Using Adobe After Effects, the project employs the Futura typeface for its clean, modern aesthetic, ensuring readability and emotional impact. Text animations, driven by keyframes and animators, reflect the film’s high-energy bull chase and poignant commentary on human insecurities. Synchronized with a hypothetical Hans Zimmer-inspired score, the animation enhances tension and drama. By focusing solely on text, it challenges viewers to engage with Jallikattu’s narrative in a novel format, fostering appreciation among independent cinema fans. Shared online, this project amplifies the film’s cultural resonance, encouraging dialogue about its exploration of civilization’s thin veneer and voyeuristic tendencies.",

    process:
      "The process of creating the kinetic typography animation in Adobe After Effects begins with scripting text to reflect Jallikattu’s key themes, such as chaos, masculinity, and societal apathy. Using the Futura typeface, text layers are created with varying weights (e.g., Medium, Bold) for visual hierarchy. Keyframes are set to animate properties like position, scale, and opacity, ensuring dynamic movement that mirrors the film’s high-energy bull chase. Animators, such as range selectors, control letter-by-letter or word-by-word motion, enhancing emotional impact. Timing is synchronized with a hypothetical Hans Zimmer-inspired score to amplify tension. The script below automates layer creation and basic animation setup. The animation is refined through previewing and adjusting easing curves for natural motion. The final output is rendered in a high-resolution format suitable for sharing with Jallikattu fans.",
